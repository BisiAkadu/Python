# Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" as the secret exit word, in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed to the screen,
# And the loop should terminate.

#code starts here

n=str(input())
while n!="chupacabra" :
    print("you've successfully exited the loop")
    break
