#Scenario
#There once was a hat. The hat contained no rabbit, but a list of five numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.
#Your task is to:
#write a line of code that prompts the user to replace the middle number in the list with an integer number entered by the user.
#write a line of code that removes the last element from the list.
#write a line of code that prints the length of the existing list.


hat_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  # This is an existing list of numbers hidden in the hat. 
print(len(hat_list))
print(hat_list)
# Step 1: write a line of code that prompts the user
z=int(input())
# to replace the middle number with an integer number entered by the user.
y=len(hat_list)//2
hat_list[y]=z
print(hat_list)
# Step 2: write a line of code that removes the last element from the list.
del hat_list[-1]
# Step 3: write a line of code that prints the length of the existing list.
print(len(hat_list))
print(hat_list)
